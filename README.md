PLOT

CASEX tells the story of a series of disappearances occurring at HELIX Laboratories, a facility specializing in DNA testing and research. The DNA evidence left behind by the culprit has been compiled and labelled as the genome CASE X, which exhibits mysterious and unique capabilities that enable the culprit to orchestrate much more than mere employee disappearances. Your role as the player is to investigate and catch CASE X before they strike again. Don’t worry – HELIX has already narrowed down the suspects to four employees. Your task is to gather information about both CASE X and these employees, ultimately deciding who you believe the culprit is. It shouldn’t be too hard, right?
